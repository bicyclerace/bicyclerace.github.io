    <h2>Viewing Overall Station Popularity</h2>
    <p>
        Station popularity can be visualized by selecting the "Popularity" icon at the bottom menu bar.
    </p>
    <div class="images">
        <video autoplay="true" loop="true">
            <source src="assets/displayPopularity.mp4" type='video/mp4'/>
        </video>
    </div>
    <p>
        The level of popularity is described by a color gradient ranging from
        <span class="highlightme" style="background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #FECC5C , #BD0026)">yellow to red</span>,
        with <span style="background-color: #BD0026">red</span> denoting the most popular station, while
        <span style="background-color: #FECC5C">yellow</span> identifies the least popular stations.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have further defined popularity based on the daily <i>in-flow and
        out-flow</i> of bikes. That is, the number of bikes that passed in and out
        of the station. We chose this representation over comparing the total
        number of bikes a station has encountered due to the fact that certain
        stations are only active for short windows of time during the year, while
        others are active year-around. By showing the average <b>daily</b>
        inflow/outflow we allow for a more equal comparison across all stations
        without misrepresenting the level of activity of one station over the other.

    </div>
    <p>
        There are three charts, each highlighting a different type of information
        about the divvy bike data.
    </p>

    <h4>Divvy rider demographics</h4>
    <p>
        The first of these charts (in the top-left corner) focuses on the Divvy
        Bike Rider Demographics, describing their Age, Gender, and how many are regular
        subscribers or one-time customers. If the user selectes the "Gender"
        button-icon, the total number of gender related statistics are presented as
        bar charts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Selecting the "Age" button-icon displays a line graph containing containing
        information related to the number of trips by age-demographic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, the User can select the "User-Type" button-icon to see a bar
        chart detailing comparing the number of paying subscribers of the Divvy
        service compared to one time use customers.
    </p>

    <h4>Number of bikes by day of week, <br>hour of day, and day of year</h4>
    <p>
        The next set of charts (top-right) examines the temporal aspects of the
        Divvy bike data by comparing the peak day of the week in terms of number
        of bikes, the most active hour of the day (and night), and the most active
        day of the year.
    <p>
        By selecting the "Day of week" button-icon, the user is presented with a
        bar-chart which displays the number of bikes out total for each day of the
        week.
    </p>
    <p>
        Selecting the "Hours of day" button-icon displays a line graph of the peak
        hours of the day in which the most bikes were taken out. The time scale
        ranges from 03am to 09pm in increments of three hours along the x axis.
    </p>
    <h4>Distribution of rides by distance, time, <br>and distance traveled for each bike</h4>
    <p>
        Each type of distribution can be examined by simply selecting the
        appropriate button-icon. When selecting the "Trip Distance" button, the
        User is presented with a line graph of the distribution of trips, or rides,
        by the distance traveled.
    </p>
    <p>
        To view the distribution of time, select the "Trip time" button-icon. This
        view displays a bar chart with the duration of trips on the x axis and the
        number of trips as the y axis.

    <p>The "Play A Day" section of the application allows for a minute-by-minute
    view of Divvy bike usage across Chicago. To switch to this mode, select
    <strong>"Play A Day"</strong> from the bottom menu. Several features are
    available:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>By clicking the calendar icon, you can select a specific month and day.</li>
        <li>A specific time of day can be chosen by increasing or decreasing
            hours and minutes, and selecting "AM" or "PM."
        </li>
        <li>Click the play button to begin animated Divvy bike usage for the
            selected date. Divvy bikes are displayed as triangles that move

        </li>
        <li>
            Divvy bikes will be shown travelling between selected stations.
            Initially, all stations will be selected. You may select individual
            stations by first clicking "None," to clear the selection, and then
            clicking on particular stations of interest.
        </li>
        <li>After selecting a station, you may click "Community" to select
            all stations in the most recently selected station's community.
        </li>
        <li>For a given time of day, the a sun/moon icon to the right of the
            current time will indicate when the sun was rising or setting for
            a given date and time.
        </li>
        <li>A box towards the upper right displays the weather conditions for the
            selected date and time.
        </li>
        <li>To the right, a chart will continuously update as the day progresses,
            showing the number of active Divvy bikes at each time of day. At any
            time, you may select several filters – below the chart – to filter
            the Divvy bike data. Filtering the data will also change the color
            of active bikes shown on the map, with filtered bikes shown in blue.

    <h2>Community Layer</h2>
    <p>
        To see the boundaries of the iconic Chicagoan communities, click on the
        map boundary button under the <strong>"Overall"</strong> view. The boundaries
        are highlighted in a red, dashed line so that they stand out to the viewer,
        without occluding ones view of the rest of the map. Each community area
        conveniently carries a label with the community name centered within the
        communities boundary, so it is easily identified from its neighbors. To
        turn off the community areas, simply click on the map boundary button again.
    </p>

    <h2>Community Area Selection</h2>
    <p>
        To select an entire community area, first select a station in a region of
        interest. Then, select the <strong>COMMUNITY</strong> button-icon near the
        bottom menu. You will notice immediately that all stations within that
        community are selected. To add additional community areas, simply select
        a station in a community area of interest, and click the <strong>COMMUNITY</strong>
        button-icon again.
        </br>
        To deselect a community area, deselect a station within a selected region,
        and (you guessed it) select the <strong>COMMUNITY</strong> button-icon.
        This will result in all the stations within the community area being deselected.
        </br>
        To select <strong>All</strong> community areas, click on the <strong>ALL</strong>
        button-icon near the bottom menu. This will select every station in every
        community.
        </br>
        To deselect all community areas, click on the <strong>NONE</strong> button-icon
        near the bottom menu. This will remove all selected stations.

    <h2>Individual Station Inflow and Outflow</h2>
    <p>
        To examine the Individual Station Inflow and Outflow, select the
        <b>"Compare"</b> button-icon on the bottom menu bar. Grey, circular icons
        will appear where the stations are located on the map. When the user selects
        a station, it will turn orange to indicate that it has been selected, and
        a series of blue lines will appear extending from the selected station to
        stations surrounding it. If the User selects <b>"outflow"</b> from the popup
        menu, a series of red lines will appear extending from the selected station to
        stations surrounding it on top of the blue lines. When the User selects "inflow"
        the blue lines are removed, showing only the red outflow lines. The User
        can turn the inflow and outflow lines on and off in any combination they
        please.

    </p>
    <h4>Inflow and outflow for two stations</h4>
    <p>
        In this same <strong>"Compare"</strong> view, any pair of stations can
        be selected by clicking on each station. When exactly two stations are
        selected, the flow balance between these two stations is shown with two
        arrows. The width of each arrow corresponds to the relative flow of bikes
        to and from each station.
    </p>
    <p>
        When two stations are selected, a line chart is also displayed, showing
        the number of rides between the two selected stations by time of day.

    <h2>Inflow and Outflow Differences</h2>
    <p>By selecting <strong>"Flow Balance"</strong> from the bottom menu, you may view the
    <strong>inflow and outflow difference</strong> for each station. Inflow and
        outflow are measured as the number of Divvy bikes entering or exiting
        a station per hour.
        <ul><li>
            Stations are colored according to their relative inflow and outflow
            – stations with high outflow are red, and stations
        with high inflow are blue.
        </li>
            <li>A specific station's inflow and outflow can be seen by
            double-clicking
                on that station.
