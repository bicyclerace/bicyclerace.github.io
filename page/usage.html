    <h2>Viewing Overall Station Popularity</h2>
    <p>
        Station popularity can be visualized by selecting the "Popularity" icon at the bottom menu bar.
    </p>
    <video autoplay="true" loop="true">
        <source src="assets/displayPopularity.mp4" type='video/mp4'/>
    </video>
    <p>
        The level of Popularity is described by a color gradient ranging from
        <span class="highlightme" style="background-image: linear-gradient(to right, yellow , red)">yellow to red</span>,
        with <span style="background-color: red">red</span> denoting the most popular station, while
        <span style="background-color: yellow">yellow</span> identifies the least popular stations.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have further defined popularity based on the daily <i>in-flow and out-flow</i> of bikes. That is, the number of bikes that passed in and out
        of the station. We chose this representation over comparing the total number of bikes a station has encountered due to the fact that
        certain stations are only active for short windows of time during the year, while others are active year-around.
        By showing the average <b>daily</b> inflow/outflow we allow for a more equal comparison across all stations without misrepresenting
        the level of activity of one station over the other.
