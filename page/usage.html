    <h2>Viewing Overall Station Popularity</h2>
    <p>
        Station popularity can be visualized by selecting the "Popularity" icon at the bottom menu bar.
    </p>
    <video autoplay="true" loop="true">
        <source src="assets/displayPopularity.mp4" type='video/mp4'/>
    </video>
    <p>
        The level of Popularity is described by a color gradient ranging from
        <span class="highlightme" style="background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #FECC5C , #BD0026)">yellow to red</span>,
        with <span style="background-color: #BD0026">red</span> denoting the most popular station, while
        <span style="background-color: #FECC5C">yellow</span> identifies the least popular stations.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have further defined popularity based on the daily <i>in-flow and
        out-flow</i> of bikes. That is, the number of bikes that passed in and out
        of the station. We chose this representation over comparing the total
        number of bikes a station has encountered due to the fact that certain
        stations are only active for short windows of time during the year, while
        others are active year-around. By showing the average <b>daily</b>
        inflow/outflow we allow for a more equal comparison across all stations
        without misrepresenting the level of activity of one station over the other.

    <h2>Viewing Overall Statistics</h2>

        <source src="assets/overallStatistics.mp4" type='video/mp4'/>
    </video>
    <p>
        There are three charts, each highlighting a different type of information
        about the divvy bike data.
    </p>

    <h4>Divvy Bike Rider Demographics</h4>
    <p>
        The first of these charts (in the top-left corner) focuses on the Divvy
        Bike Rider Demographics, describing their Age, Gender, and how many are regular
        subscribers or one-time customers. If the user selectes the "Gender"
        button-icon, the total number of gender related statistics are presented as
        bar charts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Selecting the "Age" button-icon displays a line graph containing containing
        information related to the number of trips by age-demographic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, the User can select the "User-Type" button-icon to see a bar
        chart detailing comparing the number of paying subscribers of the Divvy
        service compared to one time use customers.
    </p>

    <h4>Number of Bikes by Day of Week, Hours of day, and Day of year</h4>
    <p>
        The next set of charts (top-right) examines the temporal aspects of the
        Divvy bike data by comparing the peak day of the week in terms of number
        of bikes, the most active hour of the day (and night), and the most active
        day of the year.
    <p>
        By selecting the "Day of week" button-icon, the user is presented with a
        bar-chart which displays the number of bikes out total for each day of the
        week.
    </p>
        Selecting the "Hours of day" button-icon displays a line graph of the peak
        hours of the day in which the most bikes were taken out. The time scale
        ranges from 03am to 09pm in increments of three hours along the x axis.
    </p>
    <h4>Distribution of ride by distance, time, and distance traveled for each bike</h4>
    <p>
        Each type of distribution can be examined by simply selecting the
        appropriate button-icon. When selecting the "Trip Distance" button, the
        User is presented with a line graph of the distribution of trips, or rides,
        by the distance traveled.
    </p>
    <p>
        To view the distribution of time, select the "Trip time" button-icon. This
        view displays a bar chart with the duration of trips on the x axis and the
        number of trips as the y axis.
