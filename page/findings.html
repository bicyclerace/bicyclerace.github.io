    <h2>Divvy Stations Around UIC</h2>
    <p>Six stations around UIC were selected for analysis, and these stations were 
        compared to overall statistics for the city of Chicago between July and
        December 2013.
    </p>

    <h3>Gender Balance</h3>
    <p>The Divvy stations near UIC showed a striking difference in gender 
        balance when compared to Chicago as a whole. The overall gender balance
        of Divvy riders in Chicago is heavily skewed towards men, with roughly
        four to five more male than female riders.
    </p>
    <p>Near UIC, however, the gender balance of Divvy riders is almost equal,
        with roughly 5,000 female riders and roughly 7,000 male riders entering
        and leaving stations near UIC.

    <h3>Age</h3>
    <p>As expected for a student population, the age of Divvy riders around UIC
        was generally lower than for the overall population of Chicago. For 
        Chicago as a whole, the most common age of Divvy riders was around 30
        years old for the time period examined. For riders near UIC, the age 
        distribution was skewed, with the most common age being closer to 25
        years old.
    </p>
    <h3>User Type</h3>
    <p>The relative distribution of user type for Divvy riders near UIC was 
        nearly identical to the distribution of user types for Chicago as a 
        whole. This was a bit surprising, as one might expect more students
        to be Divvy subscribers, as opposed to one-time Divvy customers.

    <h2>Events in the City</h2>

<section>
    <h3>Beginning of School</h3>
    <p>The 2013 fall semester began on August 26. The overall city traffic on
        the first day of school was compared to traffic one week before. While
        the overall distribution of rides by time of day was not drastically
        different on the first day of school, there was a noticeable increase
        of 21-to-30 year old traffic around 8 am.

    <h3>Fourth of July</h3>
    <p>On July 4, 2013, an unsually high number of riders were active in the evening,
        as compared to typical use by hour of day. Towards the end of the evening,
        there is an abrubt drop in ridership – presumably after the fireworks
        have ended

    <h3>Opening Day at Soldier Field</h3>
    <p>The Chicago Bears opening NFL game was on September 8, 2013 against the 
        Cincinnati Bengals. The animation on the right shows a flood of Divvy
        bikes entering Solider Field (to the right of Lake Shore Drive).
    </p>
    <p>This flood of rider ends abruptly at 12:00 noon, when the game began. This
        activity is also seen as a spike in the chart of riders by time of day
        on September 8th.

    <p>Here, October 31 – a rainy Thursday, on the <strong>left</strong> 
    – is compared to October 24, one
        week earlier, on the <strong>right</strong>. <strong>Note the y-axis</strong>,
        showing that rainy days severely dampen the overall number of Divvy riders.
