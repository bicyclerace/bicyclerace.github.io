    <h2>Divvy Stations Around UIC</h2>
    <p>Six stations around UIC were selected for analysis, and these stations were 
        compared to overall statistics for the city of Chicago between July and
        December 2013.
    </p>
    <h3>Gender Balance</h3>
    <p>The Divvy stations near UIC showed a striking difference in gender 
        balance when compared to Chicago as a whole. The overall gender balance
        of Divvy riders in Chicago is heavily skewed towards men, with roughly
        four to five more male than female riders.
    </p>
    <p>Near UIC, however, the gender balance of Divvy riders is almost equal,
        with roughly 5,000 female riders and roughly 7,000 male riders entering
        and leaving stations near UIC.
    </p>
    <h3>Age</h3>
    <p>As expected for a student population, the age of Divvy riders around UIC
        was generally lower than for the overall population of Chicago. For 
        Chicago as a whole, the most common age of Divvy riders was around 30
        years old for the time period examined. For riders near UIC, the age 
        distribution was skewed, with the most common age being closer to 25
        years old.
    </p>
    <h3>User Type</h3>
    <p>The relative distribution of user type for Divvy riders near UIC was 
        nearly identical to the distribution of user types for Chicago as a 
        whole. This was a bit surprising, as one might expect more students
        to be Divvy subscribers, as opposed to one-time Divvy customers.

paul and kyle.
document patterns around particular events in the city during those months (school starting, events in grant park, games at soldier field, etc)
investigate how bike usage compares to the current weather (temperature, rain, etc)
investigate how bike usage compares to the current sunrise and sunset times


OVERALL GENDER CHART: One trend that is clearly evident, not taking into account the large subset of "unknown" responses, is the large number of men compared to women who use the Divvy service.
                      Interestingly, people in their 70's seem to take significantly larger number of trips around the city compared to their younger and older peers. The former is surprising, the latter not so much.
