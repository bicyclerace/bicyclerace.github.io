    <h1>General Patterns observed in the data</h1>
    <p>
        On December 1st, there is a fair amount of activity, more or less typical
        of what you might come to expect. However, on December 2nd, divvy bike
        usage drops to a near nothing, with very brief and small spikes of activity
        occurring periodically throughout the day. Less than 5 divvy bikes were
        utilized on that day

        Intuitively as temperatures drop, so too does the number of trips per day.
        Further, there is a direct correlation between the temperate and time of
        day. While the temperature is low, but the sun is high, there tended to be
        more trips being taken. As the evening approached, the number of trips
        per hour dropped more dramatically, often with less than 10 trips an hour.

        Across the board bike activity was high during daylight hours, meanwhile
        bike usage dropped as it grew darker outside.

OVERALL GENDER CHART: One trend that is clearly evident, not taking into account the large subset of "unknown" responses, is the large number of men compared to women who use the Divvy service.
                      Interestingly, people in their 70's seem to take significantly larger number of trips around the city compared to their younger and older peers. The former is surprising, the latter not so much.
