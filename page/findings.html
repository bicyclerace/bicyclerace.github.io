    <h2>Divvy Stations Around UIC</h2>
    <p>Six stations around UIC were selected for analysis, and these stations were 
        compared to overall statistics for the city of Chicago between July and
        December 2013.
    </p>

    <h3>Gender Balance</h3>
    <p>The Divvy stations near UIC showed a striking difference in gender 
        balance when compared to Chicago as a whole. The overall gender balance
        of Divvy riders in Chicago is heavily skewed towards men, with roughly
        four to five more male than female riders.
    </p>
    <p>Near UIC, however, the gender balance of Divvy riders is almost equal,
        with roughly 5,000 female riders and roughly 7,000 male riders entering
        and leaving stations near UIC.

    <h3>Age</h3>
    <p>As expected for a student population, the age of Divvy riders around UIC
        was generally lower than for the overall population of Chicago. For 
        Chicago as a whole, the most common age of Divvy riders was around 30
        years old for the time period examined. For riders near UIC, the age 
        distribution was skewed, with the most common age being closer to 25
        years old.
    </p>
    <h3>User Type</h3>
    <p>The relative distribution of user type for Divvy riders near UIC was 
        nearly identical to the distribution of user types for Chicago as a 
        whole. This was a bit surprising, as one might expect more students
        to be Divvy subscribers, as opposed to one-time Divvy customers.

    <h2>Events in the City</h2>

<section>
    <h3>Beginning of School</h3>
    <p>The 2013 fall semester began on August 26. The overall city traffic on
        the first day of school was compared to traffic one week before. While
        the overall distribution of rides by time of day was not drastically
        different on the first day of school, there was a noticeable increase
        of 21-to-30 year old traffic around 8 am.

    <h3>Fourth of July</h3>
    <p>On July 4, 2013, an unsually high number of riders were active in the evening,
        as compared to typical use by hour of day. Towards the end of the evening,
        there is an abrubt drop in ridership – presumably after the fireworks
        have ended

    <h3>Opening Day at Soldier Field</h3>
    <p>The Chicago Bears opening NFL game was on September 8, 2013 against the 
        Cincinnati Bengals. The animation on the right shows a flood of Divvy
        bikes entering Solider Field (to the right of Lake Shore Drive).
    </p>
    <p>This flood of rider ends abruptly at 12:00 noon, when the game began. This
        activity is also seen as a spike in the chart of riders by time of day
        on September 8th.

    <h2>Divvy Usage and the Weather</h2>
    <p>Here, October 31 – a rainy Thursday, on the <strong>left</strong> 
    – is compared to October 24, one
        week earlier, on the <strong>right</strong>. <strong>Note the y-axis</strong>,
        showing that rainy days severely dampen the overall number of Divvy riders.
        Also, on October 31 there was a brief period of no rain, around 6:00 pm,
        which corresponded to a sharp spike in ridership.

    <h2>Divvy In December</h2>
    <p>It is easy to notice that the Divvy usage decrease drastically when the winter comes.
        We inspected the usage details in a quite cold afternoon of the 10th of December.
        The graph highlight not only the low usage, but also shows the disparity of the user type.
        Can be inferred that only <strong>subscriber</strong> users use the bike with the cold weather.
        Since they have already paid the subscription for the whole year they are more prone to use the bikes
        even in not so comfortable situations.

    <h2>Flow In The Loop</h2>
    <p>
        It is interesting to study the patterns of the trips inside the Loop.
        We inspected the flow between two quite popular stations: one in the center and one in the south loop.
        It is possible to notice how the usage is focused in two time windows:
        the start of work and the end of the working day. Furthermore it is easy to see that the flow is from the South Loop
        to the Center Loop during the morning and in the opposite direction during the evening.
        This reflects the presence of affordable apartments in the South Loop and the high concentration of offices in Center Loop.

    <h2>Flow Balance In The Loop</h2>
    <p>
        While the majority of Divvy Stations around Chicago has a fair balance between bikes left and arrived during the day,
        the Loop area shows some peculiarities. During the morning there is a high number of bikes entering in the Loop,
        while after work there is a lot of bikes leaving.

    <h2>Divvy Usage and Sunrise/Sunset Times</h2>
    <p>To get a sense of the effect of sunset times on Divvy bike usage, six 
        dates were chosen, with each one falling on a Wednesday near the beginning
        of the months of July, August, September, October, November, and December.
        The earlier dates show relatively more activity later in the day.
