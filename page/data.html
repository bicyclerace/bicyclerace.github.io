<h1>Data</h1>
<section>

    <p>The data used for this project comes from 
    <a href="https://bikesharingdata.hackpad.com/Chicago-data-experiences-f1ym6mXft2d">a "cleaned up" version of the original Divvy data</a>
    made available by Steven Yance.</p>
    <p>The data includes information about all the Divvy trips that were taken 
        between 26 Jun 2013 to 31 Dec 2013.</p>
    <p>Importantly, Divvy data collection began when the Divvy service was just 
    started and plenty of stations weren't open yet.</p>
    <p>As downloaded, the data was quite clean, and only minor pre-processing 
    was necessary.</p>


    <h3>Trips with Zero Distance</h3>
    <p>Some trips start and end on the same trip. We excluded trips last less 
    than ~5 minutes â€“ we assumed that these represented instances of people who 
    got a bike and 
    returned it because it was broken.</p>

    <h2>Hosting</h2>
    <p>The data are stored on a MySQL database hosted on UIC's personal web hosting
    service. To access the database, a set of PHP API calls were developed.</p>
    
    <h2>Structure</h2>

    <p>The data was organized in two relational tables, with the following fields:</p>
    
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Table: divvy_trips_distances</th>

    <h2>Weather data</h2>
    <p>Historical weather data about Chicago was retrieved from <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/">Weather Underground</a>. 
        Weather Underground returns a huge amount of weather data for the period of the 1st of July to December 31, and since most of that data was
        not useful for the project purposes it was filtered. In particular, our project used weather observations
        at particular intervals throughout the day, with information about the time of the observation, the conditions ("Clear", "Cloudy", ..) and the
        temperature in both fahrenheit and celsius.</p>
            
    <p>
        We also kept the information about daily summaries about min and max temperature, and boolean values that indicates
        whether certain conditions (fog, rain, ..) have occurred during the day. The latter information, though, has not been
        yet been used for the project.

    <h2>Sunrise and sunset</h2>
    
    <p>Sunrise and sunset are computed using <a href="https://github.com/mourner/suncalc">SunCalc</a>, a tiny JavaScript
        library for calculating sun/moon positions and phases.
